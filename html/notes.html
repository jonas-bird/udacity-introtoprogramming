        <h1>My notes for Udacity Intro to Programming</h1>
        <p>Notes in html, I would usually use a <em>markdown</em> format for notetaking, but as it is <strong>required</strong> I do this in html...</p>
        <h2>The web and HTML</h2>
        <p>Markup is a descriptive programming language that is used to control the <em>formatting</em> of documents.</p>
        <p>Many of the terms used in computer science have evolved organically and are used in ways that are not as precise as the language we use with computers <strong>needs</strong> to be</p>
        <p>In order to facilitate writing equations and other scientific works html inclused a way to write<sup>super</sup> as well as<sub>sub</sub> scripts</p>
        <p>Some other tags in this course include a tag to <mark>highlight</mark> as <br /> well as <br /> the tag to insert linebreaks</p>
        <p>A lot of this material is review for me, but I enjoyt the chance to get some practice. This is an example of an image<img src="https://placebear.com/800/600" alt="Cute bears"></p>
        <p>HTML document structure. While it isconsidered valid to not include a head and/or body tag, when the browser creates the DOM it will create them based on its best guess as to where it belongs in the code it recieved. It is an error to place tags that imply that the body of the document has begun before elements such as the title tag that are required to be part of the head of the document</p>

      <h2>Intro to CSS</h2>
      <p>Second course!</p>
      <h3>Lesson 1: Styling with CSS</h3>
      <p>When the browser renders the DOM the block level elements are rendered as boxes.</p>
      <p>Each box has:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Padding between the content of the element and the border</li>
          <li>A border (by default not visible, but it can be made wider and displayed)</li>
          <li>A margin that controls how close other elements are displayed. Negative values can be used to create overlap</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Styling with HTML Directly</h4>
          <p>when an element is styled through the <em>style</em> attribute it is an inline style.</p>
          <p>In css a px is 1/96th of an inch</p>
          <div class="fancybox">I have less experience with CSS than I do with HTML. I will need to practice with it before I feel confident.</div>
